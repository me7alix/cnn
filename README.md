# nn.h
Simple head-only library for creating simple neural networks in C. I was inspired by this project: https://github.com/tsoding/nn.h and I tried to make it a little bit better by creating a layer abstaction that allows you to choose the function for randomizing weights and the activation function for each layer. I would be happy to get feedback because digit_recognition example does not work as well as I thought it would.

Dependencies: raylib
